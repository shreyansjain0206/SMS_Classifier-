 # SMS Spam Classifier

A simple machine learning project to classify SMS messages as spam or non-spam (ham).

## Overview

This project aims to build a text classification model that can accurately identify whether a given SMS message is spam or non-spam. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled SMS messages, and various data science techniques are employed to preprocess the data, build and evaluate the classifier.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation contains labeled SMS messages, with each message classified as spam (1) or non-spam (0). The dataset used in this project is already uploaded on this repository.
